# Project Name

HeirBloom celebrates the blossoming Locavore/Slow Food movements by highlighting fresh, local ingredients, with a focus on their preparation, as well as their availability through local independent farmers markets. Hopefully our app can be utilized to provide value to both users who prioritize cooking with fresh, sustainably sourced ingredients, as well as the farmers who grow such organic bounties.
